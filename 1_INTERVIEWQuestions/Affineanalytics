AffineAnalytics:
1.Write a Scala program to sum of n natural no?
2.write a scala program to create Fibonacci series?
3.Find the last but one element of a list (1,1,2,3,5,8)?
4.we support that a list contains elements that are list themselves. The objective is to sort the elements  of the  list according to their length Eg: short list first, longer list later, or vice versa.?

val l=List(List(1,2,3,4,5,6),List(1,2,3),List(1,2,3,4,5))
 l.sortBy(x=>x.size)
res10: List[List[Int]] = List(List(1, 2, 3), List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))

5.give a range of integres by its lower and upper limit, construct a list of all prime numbers in that range?
range(7 to 31)?

6.we support that a list contains elements that are lists themselves. but this time the objective is to sort the elements according to their length frequency; i.e in the default, sorting is done ascendingly, list with rare lengths are placed, other with a more frequency length come later?

Example:
 scala> Isortfreq(List(List('a,'b,'c), List('d,'e),List('f,'g,'h), List('d,'e), List('i,'j,'k,'I),List('m,'n), List('o)))

res1: List[List[Symbol]] = List(List('i,'j,'k,'l), List('o), List('a,'b,'c), List('f,'g,'h), List('d,'e), List('d,'e), List('m,'n))
