<property>
  <name>dfs.replication</name>
  <value>1</value>
  <description>Default block replication. 
  The actual number of replications can be specified when the file is created.
  The default is used if replication is not specified in create time.
  </description>
</property>


<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
  <value>file:///home/osboxes/YARN/hdp-data/dfs/name</value>
  <description>Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS name node
      should store the name table(fsimage).  If this is a comma-delimited list
      of directories then the name table is replicated in all of the
      directories, for redundancy. </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.data.dir</name>
  <value>file:///home/osboxes/YARN/hdp-data/dfs/data</value>
  <description>Determines where on the local filesystem an DFS data node
  should store its blocks.  If this is a comma-delimited
  list of directories, then data will be stored in all named
  directories, typically on different devices. The directories should be tagged
  with corresponding storage types ([SSD]/[DISK]/[ARCHIVE]/[RAM_DISK]) for HDFS
  storage policies. The default storage type will be DISK if the directory does
  not have a storage type tagged explicitly. Directories that do not exist will
  be created if local filesystem permission allows.
